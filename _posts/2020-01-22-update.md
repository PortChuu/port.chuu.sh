Heya all,

We added the rules regarding the Minecraft Server in [rules](/rules) (Rules 6 through 8).  These are still a draft and will be re-written very soon, but the basic idea of the rules will remain the same.

Please, please, do not x-ray or use any other cheats on the server.  It's no fun cheating on the server while everyone else plays properly.  As much as I hate to, they will be punishable by a minimum of 1-week ban going forward.  Nobody likes having to ban someone, so please follow the rules.

In case you missed, the Minecraft server is located at `port.chuu.sh`.  Review the rules, then come join us!
