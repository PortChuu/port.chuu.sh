Hello all!

I've been working on the **website design** for the last few days, and it's finally stylized and updated!  I still need to work on the contents, so if anyone would like to contribute to the contents, then please let me know!

Also, the official, stylized Dynmap page is available [here](https://port.chuu.sh/map/) !

I will likely start working on the plugin side of things in the following week.  Hopefully the beacon warp teleportation will be done soon!  Please note that the `/home` and `/bed` commands are only temporary until the warp teleportation plugin is done.  **You've been warned!**

More news to follow, so stay tuned~<br>
