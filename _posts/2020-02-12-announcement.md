Hello all!

I hope you’re all doing well!  Firstly, I believe this has to be said.

As written in the rules, **cheating is a big no on the Minecraft server.**  Everyone has to follow this rule.  An example of a blatant rulebreaking is using an x-ray texture pack to mine for diamonds.  For players in the staff team, an example of rulebreaking is using moderation tools for non-moderation purposes for personal advantage.  I have been playing fully survival and moderating when needed, and I have faith that my staff team has been following suit in not abusing their moderation powers.

**All of us together form a community.**  Within this server community, we have the staff team whose role is to keep the server, Minecraft and Discord, safe and sound.  **The staff team works as a unit,** so if one of us does something wrong, the fault carries onto the rest of the team as well.

For some time in the *past few days,* someone suspected the staff team of cheating by being in creative mode.  Regrettably, they were right.  After doing some moderation duties in spectator mode, one of us in the staff team incorrectly switched their game mode to creative and walked around in it.  One thing though: I'm sure that nobody used such power to cheat and spawn in items.  Still, the staff team warns each other to stop accidentally going into creative mode since doing so is just unfair.  There's also other cases of the staff going into vanish mode while not doing staff duties, and that's also no good.  Hence, on behalf of the staff team, I'm sorry that these suspective actions even ensued.

To eliminate the aforementioned issue from arising again, I changed around the permission structure and (finally!) **wrote a plugin dedicated to the Port Chuu MC server.**  I added some staff commands to this new plugin to limit the power of some vanilla commands.  With that,
- **Nobody** (except me) **has permission to use and get into the `/op` mode.**  The only reason to use the operator mode is when setting up new plugins.  There's no other reason to get in operator mode (except maybe in extreme cases).
- **The administrator role is retired.**  "Administrator" and "Moderator" are condensed into the new *"Detective (name pending)"* role.
- Staff cannot break or place blocks while in vanish anymore.
- Detectives can go into spectator mode.  This aids them in any investigation if need be.  Rest assured, nobody can use the other two gamemodes (creative and adventure) anymore.
- Cheerleaders can `/tempban` people for up to 30 minutes just in case an unruly player joins while the rest of the staff is offline.

And, as for everyone else, **you can now run `/kill` command** to *kill yourself* in case you are stuck somewhere and need to exit from it.  There are still more commands to come in the future, and there are also *some promotions* coming up as well.  So keep your eyes peeled on this channel!

Regards,<br>

P.S. Someone accused the staff team of spawning in items because one of them had several shulker boxes full of mending books.  In reality, you can trade mending books easily through villager trades by getting an immense discount down to 1 emerald per book.  If you're still suspicious, please take a step back from barking out and accusing the staff about everything and bring them up to me and the staff member in question instead.  It is not, and will not be, easy to be staff as we get more people after all.

TL;DR: @Announcements
- **We as the staff team done messed up.**  I’m sorry about these events, and they shouldn’t arise again with the new plugin mentioned below.
- **I’m writing the new Port Chuu plugin!**  `/kill` is now a command to instantly zero your health.
- **“Administrator” and “Moderator” are now *“Detectives”.***  The *“Detective”* role name is **subject to change with suggestions,** though.
- **There’ll be more commands and promotions** in the near future, so stay tuned!
