The goal of this community is to create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere where everyone can be comfortable.

However, all good community are backed by the rules, so before you dive into the server, check up the rules.  The rules are subject to change, so, in any case, use common sense and avoid acting in bad faith.

**Rules 1 through 5** apply to the community, and **rules 6 through 8** apply to the Minecraft server.  Everyone, including the staff and moderators, must follow these rules.  _Feel free to ask on Discord if any of the rules are unclear!_

1. **Respect the server and its members.**   We want this server to be a fun and safe place to have fun and engage in social activities.  First impressions matter, so please make good use of the opportunity!
    - Insults or any form of rude or discriminatory speech or acts are unacceptable.  A bot will immediately delete messages containing some of those blacklisted words and message you about it.
    - Swearing is alright, but try to limit your language whenever possible.

2. **Don't cause drama.**  If you have issues with another person, try to settle it through direct message responsibly.  If someone is harassing you in the server or the DMs, then alert a staff member and ignore/block the person.
    - Starting up a fight will result in a mute or a ban.

3. **About advertising: don't leech on the server.**  Do not join the server only to post links to your websites.  We know if you have been active and contributing to the community in a meaningful way, so let's get to know each other first!
    - When sharing art, linking to the author's DeviantArt, Twitter, Pixiv, etc. is alright (and encouraged)!
    - The following are okay only if you're involved in the community: asking for Pokémon trades, telling people about your YouTube or Twitch stream, and posting your social media links.
    - Do not advertise other Discord servers here.
    - Linking to sketchy websites is prohibited.
    - There aren't many emotes here, but staying here for emotes is alright!

4. **Keep server content safe for everyone.**  Don't post or use unsafe images or words, such as flashing images (epilepsy) or gore anywhere on the server.  If you must post an image that contains flashing images, then spoiler it and attach a warning to it.
    - Keep your username and profile picture appropriate.  Using NSFW imagery and refusing to change it will result in a kick or a ban.
    - Memes generally belong in meme channels.  Get the role in #reaction_role.
    - Serious discussions, such as depressing and dark topics, belong in serious channels.  Get the role in #reaction_role.
    - NSFW content only goes into NSFW channels.  If you're 18 and over, get the role in #reaction_role.

5. **No mini-modding.**  Letting people know about the rules is okay, but let the server staff handle moderation.  Ping a staff member if you see any troublemaker.
6. **Don’t cheat on the server.**  While we allow resource packs or client modifications (“mods”), we do not allow any that gives an unfair advantage over other players (e.g. x-ray texture pack, fly mod, mining bot).  Any game exploits that give you an unfair advantage over other players are strictly against the rules.
    - “TNT dupe” bug is an exception to this rule.
    - These are the [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) mods that are explicitly allowed in this server:
        - [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)
        - Minimaps (e.g. [Xaero’s Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap))
        - [Light Level Overlay Reloaded](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/light-level-overlay-reloaded)
        - [Schematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/schematica) or [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica)
    - These are not a definitive list, so do ask a staff member if you aren’t sure if a mod is allowed!

7. **Don’t steal or grief anybody.**  On Port Chuu, we don’t tolerate stealing from or griefing other players and their builds.  This includes killing anyone without their permission.
    - When you kill someone in a PvP fight, you must give back the dropped items.  In other words, you may not loot the items from another player without permission.

8. **About building:**  You can mark your territory clearly using a sign.  You may not build on land clearly claimed by another player.  Even if no marked sign is present, you may not build too close to another player without their permission.
    - Cities/settlements may have their own build claim rules.  Please respect the local laws.
    - A suggested distance is approximately 150 blocks from the claimed border.  Ask the staff if you are unsure.
    - Please keep claiming size reasonable. If you find any claim that you believe is unreasonable, talk to staff.
        - Work it out among themselves first.
        - If not available, the moderator will talk to staff
    - Please leave your in-game name in a clear, visible location in your build.
